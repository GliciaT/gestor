 * Libraries are objects that defines basic functions in a subject.
 * The Lib class defines all other libs commom methods and properties,
 * each child lib will contain functions that helps the controller to
 * execute specific tasks, like upload, encryption and other stuffs.
 *
 * All libraries must be instantiated as properties of a controller
 * and will be used by them to shortcut codes by the use of their
 * methods.
